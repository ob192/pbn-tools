# Wave Interference

Wave interference is one of the most beautiful and fundamental concepts in physics.
This article is divided into two parts:

- **Part I — For school students** (accessible, but not overly simplified)
- **Part II — University level** (deeper mathematics, phasor analysis, and general wave theory)

If you are using the accompanying simulation, you will see these formulas come alive as bright and dark patterns on the screen.

# Part I — Interference for School Students

## 1. Waves and the Principle of Superposition

A wave is a disturbance that carries energy through a medium or through space.
Examples include water waves, sound waves, and light.

When two waves meet, they do not collide or bounce off one another. Instead, they **add together**. This is called the **principle of superposition** (Halliday & Resnick, 2013):

$$
y_{\text{total}}(x,t) = y_1(x,t) + y_2(x,t)
$$

This simple idea is responsible for complex and mesmerizing patterns.

## 2. Path Difference and Phase Difference

As waves travel from two sources to one observation point, one wave often travels a slightly different distance than the other. This is the **path difference**:

$$
\Delta r = r_2 - r_1
$$

This path difference produces a **phase difference**:

$$
\Delta \varphi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \Delta r
$$

Phase tells you “where” in its cycle a wave is—whether it is at a crest, trough, or somewhere in between.

## 3. Constructive and Destructive Interference

### Constructive Interference
Occurs when two waves arrive **in phase** (Feynman, 1963):

- Crests align with crests
- Troughs align with troughs

Amplitude doubles:

$$
A_{\text{total}} = 2A
$$

Intensity quadruples:

$$
I_{\text{max}} = 4 I_0
$$

This forms **bright bands**.

### Destructive Interference
Occurs when waves arrive **half a cycle out of phase**:

$$
A_\text{total} \approx 0
$$

This forms **dark bands**, where the waves nearly cancel.

### Conditions
Constructive:

$$
\Delta r = n\lambda
$$

Destructive:

$$
\Delta r = \left(n+\tfrac12\right)\lambda
$$

## 4. Interference Pattern Geometry

With two sources separated by distance \(d\), and a screen far away (\(L \gg d\)), the path difference for a point at height \(y\) is approximately:

$$
\Delta r \approx d \frac{y}{L}
$$

Bright fringes occur at:

$$
y_n = n\frac{\lambda L}{d}
$$

This is the classical result of **Young’s double-slit experiment** (Young, 1801; Hecht, 2017).

## 5. Where We See Interference in Daily Life

- Soap bubbles showing rainbow colors
- Noise-canceling headphones
- Thin oil films on water
- Interference in radio and Wi-Fi signals
- Patterns made by musical instruments (beats & standing waves)

## 6. Experiments to Try in the Simulation

1. Decrease the wavelength → fringes become closer together
2. Increase slit separation → more fringes appear
3. Move the screen farther away → fringe spacing increases
4. Try asymmetrical amplitudes → dark fringes no longer reach complete darkness

# Part II — University-Level Wave Physics

## 7. Complex Representation of Waves

University-level wave physics typically uses **phasors** or complex exponentials, because they make interference and intensity calculations concise (Hecht, 2017; Feynman, 1963).

A monochromatic wave at frequency \(\omega\):

$$
U_1 = A_1 e^{i(\omega t - \varphi_1)}, \quad
U_2 = A_2 e^{i(\omega t - \varphi_2)}
$$

Total field:

$$
U = U_1 + U_2
$$

## 8. Intensity from Two Coherent Sources

Intensity depends on the time-averaged squared magnitude of the total field:

$$
I \propto \langle |U|^2 \rangle_t
$$

Carrying out the algebra gives the well-known formula:

$$
I = I_1 + I_2 + 2\sqrt{I_1 I_2}\cos(\Delta\varphi)
$$

If the two sources have equal intensity \(I_1 = I_2 = I_0\):

$$
I = 4 I_0 \cos^2\left(\frac{\Delta\varphi}{2}\right)
$$

The cosine term modulates the interference.

## 9. Recovering the Double-Slit Pattern

Using:

$$
\Delta\varphi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} d\frac{y}{L}
$$

we obtain:

$$
y_n = n\frac{\lambda L}{d}
$$

Dark fringes:

$$
y^\text{dark}_n = \left(n+\tfrac12\right)\frac{\lambda L}{d}
$$

These results assume **Fraunhofer diffraction** (far-field conditions).
The simulation may instead compute the full **near-field (Fresnel)** pattern.

## 10. Coherence Requirements

For a stable interference pattern:

- **Temporal coherence** (narrow bandwidth)
- **Spatial coherence** (wavefront uniformity)
- **Polarization alignment**

These are essential in interferometry and optical engineering.

## 11. What the Simulation Likely Computes

A physically realistic simulation can model each source as a point emitting a spherical wave:

$$
U_j(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{A_0}{r_j} e^{ikr_j}
$$

Total field:

$$
U(\mathbf r) = U_1 + U_2
$$

Intensity:

$$
I = |U|^2
$$

This approach is essentially a numerical version of **Huygens’ principle**.

## 12. N-Source Interference (General Case)

For \(N\) coherent sources:

$$
I = \left| \sum_{j=1}^{N} A_j e^{i\varphi_j} \right|^2
$$

This general form underlies:

- Diffraction gratings
- Phased antenna arrays
- Michelson interferometry
- Radio arrays like the VLA

## 13. A Glimpse of Quantum Interference

In quantum mechanics, the “wave” is the **probability amplitude**:

$$
\Psi = \Psi_A + \Psi_B
$$

Probability density:

$$
P = |\Psi|^2 = |\Psi_A|^2 + |\Psi_B|^2 + 2\mathrm{Re}(\Psi_A^*\Psi_B)
$$

The mathematics parallels classical interference, but now involves single particles like electrons and photons.

## 14. Advanced University-Level Exercises

- Measure fringe spacing and compare with theoretical predictions
- Fit simulation data to the cosine-squared model
- Explore unequal intensities and derive visibility:
  $$
  V = \frac{I_{\max}-I_{\min}}{I_{\max}+I_{\min}}
  $$
- Extend to three or more sources
- Study transition from Fresnel to Fraunhofer diffraction
