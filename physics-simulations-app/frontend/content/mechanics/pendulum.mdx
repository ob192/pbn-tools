# Understanding Pendulum Motion

## Introduction

A simple pendulum consists of a mass (called the bob) suspended from a fixed point by a string or rod of length L. When displaced from its equilibrium position and released, it swings back and forth in a periodic motion.

This simulation demonstrates the fundamental principles of pendulum motion, allowing you to explore how different parameters affect the oscillation.

## The Physics Behind It

### Equation of Motion

The motion of a simple pendulum is governed by the equation:

**θ'' = -(g/L) × sin(θ)**

Where:
- **θ** is the angular displacement from equilibrium
- **g** is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²)
- **L** is the length of the pendulum

### Small Angle Approximation

For small angles (less than about 15°), we can approximate sin(θ) ≈ θ, which gives us simple harmonic motion with period:

**T = 2π × √(L/g)**

## Key Observations

Try experimenting with the simulation to observe:

1. **Period Independence**: For small angles, the period does not depend on the amplitude
2. **Length Dependence**: Longer pendulums swing more slowly
3. **Energy Conservation**: Watch how kinetic and potential energy exchange
4. **Damping Effects**: With damping enabled, observe how the motion decays over time

## Energy Analysis

The total mechanical energy of the pendulum consists of:
- **Kinetic Energy**: (1/2) × m × L² × θ'²
- **Potential Energy**: m × g × L × (1 - cos(θ))

## Real-World Applications

Pendulums have many practical applications:

- **Clocks**: Grandfather clocks use pendulums for timekeeping
- **Seismometers**: Detect ground motion during earthquakes
- **Metronomes**: Help musicians maintain tempo
- **Construction**: Ensure buildings are perfectly vertical

## Try This

1. Set the damping to 1.0 (no damping) and observe perpetual motion
2. Click at different positions to set various initial angles
3. Adjust the length and notice how the period changes

## Summary

The simple pendulum is a fundamental example of oscillatory motion in physics. Its behavior illustrates key concepts like simple harmonic motion, energy conservation, and the relationship between period and length.
