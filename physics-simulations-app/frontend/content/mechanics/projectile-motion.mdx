# Projectile Motion

## Introduction

Projectile motion describes the motion of an object thrown into the air, subject only to the acceleration of gravity. This is a fundamental concept in classical mechanics and has applications ranging from sports to space exploration.

## The Physics

### Equations of Motion

A projectile launched with initial velocity v₀ at angle θ follows these equations:

**Horizontal position:** x(t) = v₀ × cos(θ) × t

**Vertical position:** y(t) = v₀ × sin(θ) × t - (1/2) × g × t²

**Horizontal velocity (constant):** vₓ = v₀ × cos(θ)

**Vertical velocity:** vᵧ(t) = v₀ × sin(θ) - g × t

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Formula |
|-----------|---------|
| Maximum Height | H = v₀² × sin²(θ) / (2g) |
| Time of Flight | T = 2 × v₀ × sin(θ) / g |
| Range | R = v₀² × sin(2θ) / g |

## Optimal Launch Angle

For maximum horizontal range on level ground, the optimal launch angle is **45°**. This can be proven by finding when sin(2θ) is maximum.

## Experiment Ideas

1. **Find the optimal angle**: Which angle gives maximum range?
2. **Height vs Range**: Compare trajectories at 30° and 60°
3. **Speed effects**: How does doubling velocity affect range?

## Real-World Considerations

In reality, projectiles experience:
- **Air resistance** (drag)
- **Wind effects**
- **Spin** (Magnus effect)
- **Varying gravity** (for long-range projectiles)

This simulation assumes ideal conditions with no air resistance.
